Doing some basic sanity checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
g++     cyoa-step1.cpp   -o cyoa-step1
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page1.txt 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page8.txt 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page11.txt 
Your file matched the expected output

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
g++     cyoa-step2.cpp   -o cyoa-step2
Testing ./cyoa-step2 story1 2\n1\n
Line_1_did_not_match
Line_2_did_not_match
Line_3_did_not_match
Line_4_did_not_match
Line_5_did_not_match
Line_81_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected ouput
Testing ./cyoa-step2 story1 1\n4\n1\n3\n
Line_1_did_not_match
Line_2_did_not_match
Line_3_did_not_match
Line_4_did_not_match
Line_5_did_not_match
Line_54_did_not_match
Line_92_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected ouput

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
The code did not compile!

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
The code did not compile!

Step 1: PASSED
Step 2: FAILED
Step 3: FAILED
Step 4: FAILED
