Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page8.txt 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page11.txt 
Your file matched the expected output

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *.o *~
g++     cyoa-step2.cpp   -o cyoa-step2
Testing ./cyoa-step2 story1 2\n1\n
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step2 story1 1\n4\n1\n3\n
Your file matched the expected output

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f *.o *~
g++     cyoa-step3.cpp   -o cyoa-step3
Testing ./cyoa-step3 story1 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step3 cycle 
Your file matched the expected output

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *.o *~
g++     cyoa-step4.cpp   -o cyoa-step4
Testing ./cyoa-step4 one_win 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step4 story1
Your output matched the expected output

Step 1: PASSED
Step 2: PASSED
